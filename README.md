# Bangalore House Price Prediction

# Project Overview
The Bangalore House Price Prediction project aims to predict the prices of houses in Bangalore using a linear regression model. The prediction is based on various features such as the number of bedrooms, location, square footage, and other relevant factors that influence house prices.

# Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains information about various properties in Bangalore, including features such as:

Location: The area where the property is located.
Size: The number of bedrooms in the house.
Total Square Foot Area: The total area of the property in square feet.
Number of Bathrooms: The number of bathrooms in the property.
Price per Square Foot: The price of the property per square foot.
Availability: When the property is available for sale.
The dataset was sourced from [mention the source if applicable].

# Requirements
To run this project, you need to have the following Python libraries installed:

numpy
pandas
matplotlib
seaborn
scikit-learn
You can install the required libraries using the following command:



# Before training the model, the dataset undergoes the following preprocessing steps:

Handling Missing Values: Missing values are either filled with appropriate values or removed.
Feature Engineering:
Converting categorical variables (like location) into numerical values using techniques such as one-hot encoding.
Removing outliers based on domain knowledge and exploratory data analysis.
Normalization: Scaling numerical features to ensure they have similar ranges.
Model Building
The linear regression model is built using the scikit-learn library. The steps include:

Splitting the Data: The dataset is split into training and testing sets.
Training the Model: The linear regression model is trained on the training data.
Evaluating the Model: The modelâ€™s performance is evaluated using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared.
Results
After training the model, the following metrics were used to evaluate its performance
# Best Score
linear_regression:	0.818354	
1	lasso:	0.687429	
2	decision_tree:	0.754222
The results indicate that the model performs well in predicting house prices in Bangalore.

Conclusion
This project demonstrates the use of linear regression to predict house prices in Bangalore. While the model provides a good starting point, further improvements can be made by exploring more complex models, feature engineering, and hyperparameter tuning.

Future Work
Experiment with other regression models like decision trees, random forests, or gradient boosting machines.
Incorporate additional features such as proximity to amenities, crime rates, and school ratings to improve model accuracy.
Implement hyperparameter tuning to optimize model performance.
